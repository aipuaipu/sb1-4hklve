# Node.js Starter Project

This is a simple starter project for Node.js applications using Express.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server with hot-reloading
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

## Scripts

- `npm start`: Starts the server
- `npm run dev`: Starts the server with nodemon for development
- `npm test`: Placeholder for running tests (not implemented in this starter)

## Dependencies

- Express: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js
- Nodemon (dev dependency): Utility that monitors for any changes in your source and automatically restarts your server

Feel free to modify and expand upon this starter as needed for your project!
